V 1.1
--------------------------
- Moved the button in the inventory to the top left.
- Left and right clicking on a filter will now open the context menu.
- Improved the salvaging code. (Turns out SexiiSteak pointed out "ON_INVENTORY_ENTRY_CHANGED" to but I forgot to check up on it untill vDepth pointed it out again later, so thanks to both of them)
- The check all check box will now uncheck itself if you uncheck an option after using it.
- Added /scrapii and /scrap to open the Filter UI.
- Added /srl and /review to open the review list.
- Added options to the interface options allowing you to disable salvaging in certain instances, eg Baneclaw (Thanks to Kuro for the suggestion).
- Swaped the salvage / don't salvage options on the loot pop-up, so don't salvage is on the left. This should help avoid accidental salvaging.
- Now verifies that an item still exists when opening the review list.
- Fixed Scrapii trying to salvage other players loot sometimes.
- Replaced the place holder pop up with prettier ones.
- New filters will now default to Queue for review.
- Unneeded option in the add filter window will now be greyed out when they aren't needed.
- Various small UI fixes and tweaks.
- Added simple sorting to the filters, the order you see them in is the order that they will be processed in.
- Added the ablity to have multiple differn't filter sets.
- Added some sounds to actions like opening a popup or on error.
- Fixed issue with the "Include Archetype" check box always showing as checked (was only a dispaly issue).
- Added German translation by Maxunit941.
- Added French translation by Maekess.
