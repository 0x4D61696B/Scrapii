V 1.6
--------------------------
- Added Operation Miru to the salvage zones list.
- Added the option to enable running filters over your inventory.
- Due to the above the "Test Filters" option will no longer show equipment that you have equipped on frames.
- Fixed the review list panel from rendering above the add filter pop up.
- Added an option to allow salvaging in unknown zones, this is incase a new zone has been released but I haven't added it to Scrapii's zone list, if this option is checked Scrapii will salvage items in zones it doesn't know of.

V 1.5
--------------------------
- Some xml tidy ups to avoid issues
- Reduced console spam on undefined zones.

--------------------------
- Fixed an issue that could cause the review list to become corrupt and prevent the review UI from opening.
- Fixed an issue where some new weapons eg. "" would not salvage.
- Added a new command "/stest itemID" that will test an item against your filters. itemID is an SDB ID, 114495 is "Burrowing Sticky Launcher"

V 1.3
--------------------------
- Fixed an issue that prevented it from salvaging more than one junk salvage on pick up.
- Made it clear that the second Devils Tusk entry in settings is for the Warfront Raid.
- Fixed an issue where on a fresh install filter would not be saved until a filter group was made.
- Fixed an issue where the review window would be visible on UI load or loading screens

V 1.1
--------------------------
- Moved the button in the inventory to the top left.
- Left and right clicking on a filter will now open the context menu.
- Improved the salvaging code. (Turns out SexiiSteak pointed out "ON_INVENTORY_ENTRY_CHANGED" to but I forgot to check up on it untill vDepth pointed it out again later, so thanks to both of them)
- The check all check box will now uncheck itself if you uncheck an option after using it.
- Added /scrapii and /scrap to open the Filter UI.
- Added /srl and /review to open the review list.
- Added options to the interface options allowing you to disable salvaging in certain instances, eg Baneclaw (Thanks to Kuro for the suggestion).
- Swapped the salvage / don't salvage options on the loot pop-up, so don't salvage is on the left. This should help avoid accidental salvaging.

- New filters will now default to Queue for review.

- Added some sounds to actions like opening a popup or on error.
- Fixed issue with the "Include Archetype" check box always showing as checked (was only a display issue).
